# Backup Data

This directory contains backup data for projects that are no longer active or have been removed from the main portfolio.

## Structure

- `swiftdrones_data.json`: Contains the complete data for the SwiftDrones website project, which is no longer online.

## Purpose

This backup serves as a historical record of past projects and their details. The data can be used for:
- Reference of past work
- Potential future project restoration
- Portfolio updates if the project becomes active again

## Data Format

The backup files maintain the same JSON structure as the main `data.json` file, ensuring consistency and easy integration if needed in the future.
