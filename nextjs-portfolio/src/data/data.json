This thesis presents a tool that automates the generation of graphical representations from textual variants of UML sequence diagrams (SDs) and activity diagrams (ADs), utilizing the MontiCore language workbench. Designed to enhance model-driven software engineering (MDSE) methodologies, this tool is integrated into the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment through an extension.",

A key feature of this tool is the bidirectional navigation between textual and visual representations, allowing users to transition from code to diagram and vice versa. This functionality improves the accessibility and utility of MDSE visualizations and facilitates a deeper understanding of UML diagrams.",
              "The main goal of the tool is to provide direct visualization inside VS Code, allowing for a side-by-side view with the textual model on one side and the visualization on the other. The extension dynamically generates and updates visualizations based on any modifications within the text document.",

Our goal is to make language learning accessible, engaging, and flexible for modern learners by leveraging advanced natural language processing.",
                "Initially, our ideas focused on using news articles and generated exercises to help users improve their language skills. The platform was designed to allow users to select their target language and proficiency level, after which it would provide relevant news articles in the target language. Exercises based on these articles, such as vocabulary quizzes, grammar exercises, and comprehension questions, were also part of the plan. We intended to continue developing the platform beyond the competition deadline of August 12, 2024.",
                "For the competition, we delivered a platform called LLInvoker that integrates the Gemini API to generate A1-level exercises in both German and French. Users can request customized exercises based on their language level and topics of interest. We also included a feature where Gemini corrects and verifies users' answers, offering a more interactive learning experience. Additionally, users can generate custom exercises through a chat feature, allowing them to select exercise types and incorporate images or descriptions to create personalized learning activities. While the platform is in its alpha stage and some features from our initial plans are still under development, we believe LLInvoker demonstrates significant potential.",
                "Looking forward, we plan to collaborate with educational institutions and introduce more advanced exercises, such as those initially planned with news articles, reading exercises, and conversational practice that offers pronunciation feedback. We're also considering a rework of the frontend to make it more playful and user-friendly, likely switching to React Native due to our team's experience with similar frameworks. To get a better idea of our project, you can check out the video we submitted for the competition."
