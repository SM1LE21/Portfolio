# tun.keltesch.dev – Redesign Content & UX Brief

## 1. Purpose & Goals

**Primary goals (next 60 days)**  
- Position Tun as an **interesting, high-upside tech entrepreneur** (not "employee with side projects").  
- Build **investor and networking credibility**: people should think "I want to meet/work with this guy."  
- Clearly show:  
  - Tun as a **founder-engineer**  
  - **TK MEDIA** as his software studio  
  - A small set of **serious products** (ExpenseMate, NegotiationEdge)  
  - A playground of **experiments** that show range and curiosity  

**Not goals**  
- No pricing, no package details, no "book a project" flow here. Sales stays on tkmedia.lu.  
- No public mention of FOUNTA yet (only a vague stealth hint, see below).

---

## 2. Brand Narrative

**Current perception (from the old site)**  
- "Project Engineer at Hexagon in Vienna who builds some apps on the side."

**Target perception**  
- "Founder-engineer running a lean software studio (TK MEDIA), shipping real products (ExpenseMate, NegotiationEdge), with a clear, interesting thesis about AI, negotiation, and sports / performance."

**One-line reaction we want**  
> "Damn, this guy is interesting – I want to connect, work with him, or at least know what he's building next."

---

## 3. Site Structure

### 3.1. Hero Section

**Goal:** Immediately frame Tun as founder + studio owner + product builder.

- **Title (H1)**  
  "Tun Keltesch | Founder-Engineer Building AI-Native Products in Europe"

- **Subline (2–3 lines)**  
  Example direction (tweak wording as needed):  
  > Founder of TK MEDIA, a small software studio shipping web and AI tools in weeks, not months.  
  > Building products around negotiation, money, and performance – currently ExpenseMate and NegotiationEdge.

- **CTA(s)**  
  - Primary: "Get in touch" (email/LinkedIn)  
  - Secondary: "See my products" (scroll to Products section)

No mention of Hexagon here.

---

### 3.2. About Tun

**Goal:** Founder story, not CV.

Content blocks (short, sharp):

- **Who I am**  
  - Multilingual developer & builder (Luxembourg / Austria / Europe).  
  - 6+ years building distributed/backend/frontend and data-heavy systems.  
  - Now focused on turning that experience into products and a studio.

- **What I care about**  
  - AI-native tools that make negotiation, money, and performance training less opaque.  
  - Automation that kills boring workflows.  
  - Small, sharp engineering teams over big slow ones.

- **Background**  
  - "Previously: Project Engineer at Hexagon (Safety, Infrastructure & Geospatial) working on X/Y-type systems."  
  - This should be one compact paragraph under a small "Previously" label, not the main framing.

---

### 3.3. TK MEDIA Section

**Goal:** Make it clear that Tun operates through a studio, without turning this into a sales page.

- **Section title**: "TK MEDIA | My Software Studio"

- **Short copy (2–3 sentences)**  
  Example direction:  
  > TK MEDIA is a small software studio I started to build and ship products fast.  
  > We focus on web apps and AI automation for European businesses, and we also build and own our own products like ExpenseMate and NegotiationEdge.

- **Link**  
  - Button: "Visit TK MEDIA →" (to tkmedia.lu)  
  - No pricing or tiers replicated here.

---

### 3.4. Products (TK MEDIA–Owned)

**Goal:** Showcase 2 serious products as actual bets, not toys.

**Section title:** "Products"

Each product gets a card or mini-section:

1. **ExpenseMate**  
   - Tag: `Product · TK MEDIA`  
   - One-liner: "Smart receipt scanning and bill-splitting app that turns messy group expenses into clean, fair splits."  
   - Very short description: 2–3 bullets max (e.g. scan receipt, auto-detect items, split with friends/travel groups).  
   - Link: "View ExpenseMate →" (expensemate.app)

2. **NegotiationEdge**  
   - Tag: `Product · TK MEDIA`  
   - One-liner: "AI negotiation coach that lets you practice high-stakes conversations in realistic simulations."  
   - Short copy anchored on: "I wanted to get better at negotiation… so I built the tool I wanted."  
   - Link: "View NegotiationEdge →" (negotiationedge.app)

**Important:** Wording should emphasize:  
- Built by Tun,  
- Owned by TK MEDIA,  
- Not described as "personal / relatively new / solo developer project".

---

### 3.5. Experiments / Lab

**Goal:** Show curiosity and range without diluting the main products.

**Section title:** "Experiments & Tools"

- Short intro line:  
  > Small tools and experiments I built while exploring new ideas and tech.

- List / grid of projects with 1 line each, e.g.:  
  - Text2UML – "Turn natural language into UML diagrams for faster system thinking."  
  - Tennis Coach AI – "Early prototype for AI-assisted feedback on racket sports."  
  - TK CHAT, CanvasCraft, LLInvoker, portfolio experiments, etc.

No heavy detail; keep this obviously "lab" tier.  

---

### 3.6. Now / Next

**Goal:** Signal direction; seed future FOUNTA narrative without naming it.

**Section title:** "Now & Next"

Bullets, for example:

- "Evolving ExpenseMate from social bill-splitting into a broader money management companion."  
- "Preparing NegotiationEdge for broader early-adopter testing."  
- "Exploring a stealth AI product in racket sports performance and coaching."

This is the only place that hints at FOUNTA. No names, no funding, no team claims.

---

### 3.7. Contact / Connect

**Goal:** Make it extremely easy for investors, operators, and interesting people to reach out.

Copy example:

> If you invest in or collaborate with technical founders – or you're building in AI, negotiation, or sports tech – I'd love to connect.  
>  
> [Email] · [LinkedIn] · [Optional: X/IG if you actually use them for this persona]

No contact form needed unless you want one; a mailto + LinkedIn is enough.

---

## 4. Tone, Style & Visual Direction

### 4.1. Tone

- Confident but not hypey.  
- Concrete over buzzwords.  
- Short paragraphs, strong headings.  
- Personal voice is good ("I built…", "I care about…"), as in NegotiationEdge's current copy.

### 4.2. Visuals

- Overall feel closer to: **alvarogellings.com** – clean, text-led, lots of white space, strong typography.  
- 2–3 high-quality photos of Tun:
  - Close-up portrait  
  - Working at laptop / whiteboard  
  - Optional: sports/racket context shot for subtle tie-in  
- Product visuals:
  - 1–2 polished UI screens for ExpenseMate  
  - 1–2 for NegotiationEdge  
  - Experiments can be simple badges or minimal thumbnails.

## 5. What to Remove or De-emphasize From the Current Site

From the current tunkeltesch.dev, **these should be removed or heavily reworked**:

1. **Hexagon as primary identity**  
   - Remove anything where the main heading/subheading is "Project Engineer at Hexagon in Vienna" or similar.  
   - Keep Hexagon only in a compact "Previously" paragraph under About.

2. **"Relatively new / solo developer" type language** (even if technically true)  
   - This framing exists on ExpenseMate and in your broader narrative and weakens investor confidence.  
   - All public copy should present you as a capable founder-engineer, not an "early, unsure dev".

3. **Overlong project list treated equally**  
   - Do not keep a flat list where ExpenseMate, NegotiationEdge, and every minor tool are visually equivalent.  
   - Only ExpenseMate + NegotiationEdge belong as top-tier "Products"; the rest go under "Experiments / Lab."

4. **Anything that reads like a CV / job application**  
   - Timeline-style "I started with backend in 2018, then did frontend…" is fine background, but not as the main hero.  
   - Remove explicit "available for hire as [role]" signals if they exist; this is a founder/networking site, not a job-hunting page.

5. **Redundant or low-signal tech-stack badges**  
   - If there are long lists of tech logos/skills, cut or move them to a very small "Tech I use" block at most.  
   - The primary proof is shipped products and TK MEDIA, not the stack checklist.

6. **Anything that attempts to sell services directly**  
   - Pricing tables, "packages," detailed process flows: keep that on tkmedia.lu.  
   - Here, only a short TK MEDIA section + link out.

---

## 6. Implementation Notes for Dev/Design

- Domain stays: **tun.keltesch.dev**.  
- This is a **personal founder site** that prominently features TK MEDIA.  
- tkmedia.lu remains the **studio sales site**.  
- Respect clear hierarchy:
  - Hero/About → TK MEDIA → Products → Experiments → Now/Next → Contact.  
- Mobile-first, very clean typography, minimal color palette (aligned with TK MEDIA for subtle brand coherence, but this can be tuned by design).  

---

## Next Steps

1. Draft layout mockups based on this structure.  
2. Write actual copy for Hero, About, TK MEDIA, Products (aligned with the tone above).  
3. Coordinate with ExpenseMate team to update "Behind The App" language to remove "solo / relatively new" framing.  
4. Prepare 2–3 high-quality photos of Tun + polished product screenshots.  
5. Review and finalize before FOUNTA announcement timeline.
